# LagrangePointFinder

When attempting to described the dynamics of the circular restricted three body problem, application of the Lagrangian apporach to the massless body results in the emergence of a differential equation for the pottential with no analytical solution in existence. Therefore, in order to find a classify the stationary points within the rotating frame, The Lagrange Points, an algorithm such as the Newton Rhapson method must be implemented.

The python script Newton_method.py contains functions allowing for the Newton Raphson method to be implemented to find, classify and plot the Lagrange points for a massless body in the prescence of a two body orbiting system (The CR3BP),
